/* I Do Declare!
    Declare variables of the following types:
        4 Numbers
        3 Strings
        2 Booleans
        1 Undefined Variable
    Give the variables descriptive names (ex: string1 and string2)
    Print each one to the console with a description (ex: console.log("The First String:", string1);)
    Try to be creative! (don't use 1, 2, 3, and 4 for your numbers -- test out negatives or decimals!) */
